# OzzSnake

A tiny ASCII Snake game in Python.

Features
- Small, single-file Python implementation
- Cross-platform input handling (Windows and Unix-like)
- Terminal-based gameplay
- Score tracking

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- On Windows the script uses `msvcrt` for key input (built-in).
- On Unix-like systems the script uses a small raw-input fallback.

Controls
- W / A / S / D or arrow keys — move
- Q or Ctrl-C — quit

Run
- From a terminal: `python ozzsnake.py`

Notes
- This repo contains a tiny game intended for learning/fun. If you want a package, packaging, or enhancements (difficulty levels, high score save, etc.), I can add them.
